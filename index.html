    <h2>Hostel Life Experience</h2>
    
    <p > There’s nothing else like it. Cuz honestly, nothing beats playing dumb charades with your roomies at 2 AM. Or getting your entire hostel to celebrate your roomie’s birthday. Or everyone crashing on the same bed (like dead french fries) after the party is over. In short, hostel life is one helluva roller coaster.

      There are hardly any hostels like Stanza Living residences. We have it all figured out. Unlike other PG owners, we don’t just vanish after giving you the keys. We stay around to make your life easier. Like preparing home-like meals three times a day, taking out your laundry and keeping your rooms clean. And when you’re not doing anything important, we have an exciting entertainment zone (with unlimited wifi, gaming consoles and pool tables). And don’t worry, we’re not trying to paint a rosy picture. It’s just that we ARE the rosy picture. But before you already decide to pack your bags (and begin to convince your mum), you need to know everything about hostel life. So bookmark this ‘hostel life article’ and you don’t have to keep guessing what’s ahead of you. Like playing dumb charades.

      Pros of Hostel life...

    <h3>Obtaining a global exposure</h3>

      Living in a hostel will have you meet people who are from different communities, countries, and walks of life. A hostel provides a very rare opportunity to socialize and collaborate with many such individuals. Honing that skill in India can help you thrive in any social and professional environment with a person of any nationality!

  <h3>Discipline is not always boring</h3>

  <p>
    The chances of lazing around in a hostel are not very high. Unless you really want to, which is totally cool. But if you’re studying for a big entrance exam, and if your roommates are on it too – it keeps your motivation up. On top of it, when you’re living with a community (like in a hostel), a schedule comes easy. And it builds a lot of discipline in your lifestyle. So living away from home might not always be a messy lifestyle like your parents imagine it to be.

  <h3>DO-IT-YOURSELF</h3>

    Yup, you can no longer scream your lungs out to ask your mum to fetch you a glass of water. You just have to do it yourself. And a lot of other things too. Like managing your allowances, taking care of your essentials and keeping yourself healthy (and hydrated). So not having anyone around helps you become independent and self-reliant. Unlike Sheldon Cooper. Imagine if he didn’t have Leonard.

  <h3>Close to everything</h3>

  <p >
 When you’re in a hostel (which is conveniently located), it saves you a lot of time, effort and money. So you can use them to indulge in your favourite hobbies, or going out for a burger or just time to work more on your goals. Also, you’re always close to your friends (your roomies). Which comes in very handy the night before big exams for which you’ve – as always – have not prepared.
